        <b><h2>The 18th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2022)</h2>
        <p>December 14-16, 2022, Guangzhou, China</p></b>
        <a href="https://ieee-msn.org/2022">https://ieee-msn.org/2022</a>
        <h1>Call for Workshops</h1>
        <p>IEEE MSN has been a premier venue for presenting scholarly research on mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks. Advances in this field are leading to innovative platforms, protocols, systems, and applications for the next-generation mobile networks, Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems. With its 18th anniversary, MSN 2022 will be held at Guangzhou, China.</p>

        <p>In MSN 2021, we successfully organized five workshops, and this year the MSN 2022 will continue inviting proposals for one-day or half-day workshops, to be held prior to or immediately after the main conference. The purpose of the workshops is to provide a venue for presenting novel ideas in a less formal and typically more focused area than the main conference. Workshops should be organized to promote lively interaction, and plans to promote interaction and discussion must be clearly addressed in the written workshop proposals. The organizers of accepted workshops are required to announce the workshop and call for papers, solicit submissions, conduct the reviewing process, and decide upon the final workshop program. At least one organizer must be physically present at the workshop.</p>

        <p>Workshop proposals are solicited in all areas and topics pertaining to research and applications in Mobility, Sensing and Networking. Workshops addressing new emerging research directions in Mobility, Sensing and Networking are especially welcome. Further, workshops with novel formats, e.g., focused on a specific topic in a tutorial-style fashion, are strongly encouraged. Workshop papers will be included and indexed in the IEEE digital libraries (Xplore). The page limit for accepted regular workshop papers is 6 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.</p>

        <h2>Proposal Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Workshop proposals should be submitted (in PDF format) no later than <span style="color:red;">May 15</span>, 2022 by e-mail to the MSN 2022 Workshop Co-chairs (see email id below), with "MSN 2022 Workshop Proposal" in the subject. Each proposal must include:</p>

            <li>A brief description of the workshop with a list of the technical issues/topics that the workshop will address. Some example topics of interest might be Edge computing, Mobile crowdsensing, Using AI for intelligent management and communications in Ad Hoc networks, etc.</li>
            <li>A description of the publicity plan.</li>
