<h1>Virtual Presentation Guidelines</h1>
<p>As MSN 2022 will be held as an online conference, <b>authors of accepted papers are required to record and submit a video, and slides of your talk by November 30, 2022.</b></p>

<p>Please <b>be present in your session at least 10 minutes before the beginning of the session</b> and <b>report to the session chair</b>. Papers without the slide and video submission before the deadline and the absence of the registered author during the scheduled presentation time will be treated as NO SHOW, and the paper will not be published in the final proceedings.</p>

<p>MSN 2022 requires authors to prepare a <b>20-minute</b> talk for <b>full papers</b> or a <b>10-minute</b> talk for <b>short papers and workshop papers</b>.</p>

<h2>Video Preparation</h2>
<p>Please refer to the step-by-step tutorial (<a href="files/record_tutorial.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> ) on how your video should be prepared (including a requirement for including picture-in-picture window). Once you finish preparing your video, please follow the instructions below and <a>upload your slides and talk videos by November 30, 2022.</a></p>
